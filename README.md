# The Final Stand

The Final Stand is a co-operative zombie survival defense game. It's written in JavaScript (ES5) and builds on the Rune SDK (courtesy of Henrik Andersen aka Vector Panic https://github.com/VectorPanic).

## Gameplay

In The Final Stand, you and three other players form a team, striving to survive wave after wave of relentless zombie onslaughts. As you fend off the zombies, they drop moneybags upon defeat, providing your team with the resources needed to upgrade your arsenal from the weapon crate.

The challenge intensifies with each wave as the zombies grow stronger, their health points increasing to make them harder to kill. To add to the unpredictability, zombies can randomly receive buffs at the start or during a wave, enhancing their movement speed and health.

The game also features a scoring system that keeps track of the number of waves your team has survived and the number of zombies you've vanquished in each wave.
